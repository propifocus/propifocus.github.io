<p><strong>SECTION 1 &#8211; DISCLOSURE</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION 2- WordPress</strong></p>
<p>Our website was created withÂ <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress</a>. They provide us with a platform that allows us to present products and services to you.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION 3 &#8211; THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</strong></p>
<p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.<br />
However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.<br />
For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.<br />
Once you leave our website âs website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our websiteâs Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Links<br />
When you click on links on our website, they may direct you away from our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION 4- SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION 5 &#8211; COOKIES</strong></p>
<p>By using or accessing the Website, you are consenting to use of Cookies as follows: This policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the Website (referred to in this policy as âweâ, âusâ or âourâ). âCookiesâ are text-only pieces of information that a website transfers to an individualâs hard drive or other website-browsing equipment for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow the Website to remember important information that will make your use of the site more convenient. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the âlifetimeâ of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value. Certain cookies will be used on the Site regardless of whether you are logged in to your account or not. Â Like most websites, we use cookies for a variety of purposes in order to improve your online experience, for analytics and for marketing, but specifically, we use Cookies on the Website for the following purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analytical Purposes: We use Cookies to analyze user activity in order to improve the Website. For example, using Cookies we can look at aggregate patterns like the average number of productÂ searches that users perform. We can use such analysis to gain insights about how to improve the functionality and user experience of the Website.</li>
<li>Your Preferences: We use Cookies to store certain user preferences on our Website. For example, we may store the recent searches you have performed in a Cookie so that we can allow you to easily repeat those searches when you return to our Website.</li>
<li>Marketing: We use Cookies from third-party partners such as Google and Facebook for marketing purposes. These Cookies allow us to display promotional material to you on other sites you visit across the Internet. We may also share information about your behavior on the Site with third parties (including operators of third-party websites and/or social networking sites) in order to show you targeted advertisements and other content that has been customized for you.</li>
<li>Referral Tracking: We use Cookies to associate user activity with the third party website that referred the user to our Website, or to associate user activity thatÂ we referred to a third party website. These third-party partner websites receive credit for the activity of users they refer to our Website or give us credit for the activity of users referred to such third party websites. We do not share any personal information or information about individual user activities with these partner entities.</li>
</ol>
<p>Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Website. Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). When we use session cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Website, this is done on an anonymous aggregate basis (as cookies do not in themselves carry any personal data). We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used to return to the Website to help customize your web experience. We may associate personal information with a cookie file in those instances. Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. You can easily delete any cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser. See below instructions on how to enable and disable cookies for various browsers:</p>
